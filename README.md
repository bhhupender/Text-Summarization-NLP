# Text-Summarization-NLP
Text Summarization Tool using NLP and Transformers

This project implements a powerful text summarization tool capable of generating both extractive and abstractive summaries. It combines traditional NLP techniques with modern transformer-based models like T5. A sleek and user-friendly interface is provided using Streamlit, allowing users to input text and generate summaries effortlessly.

Features:

Extractive summarization using frequency-based sentence scoring.
Abstractive summarization leveraging the T5 transformer model.
Interactive user interface for seamless input and output display.
Technologies Used:

NLP Libraries: NLTK for preprocessing and scoring.
Transformers: Hugging Face's T5 model for abstractive summarization.
Frontend: Streamlit for a professional and intuitive user interface.
How to Use:

Clone the repository and install dependencies from requirements.txt.
Run the script to launch the Streamlit-based summarization tool.
Input any text into the tool and click "Summarize" to view results.
